# Generalized Lotka-Volterra Model with Evolution
This repository simulates the ecological interactions between species under a stochastic framework of the generalized Lotka-Volterra model undergoing evolution subject to a multi-species Moran process. 

The generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV) model is a set of differential equations that is used to express the ecological relationships between species in an ecological locale. The flexible parameterization of the gLV model allows for it to capture a wide variety of dynamic behaviors important to ecological stability and fluctuations amongst interacting species. 

Let there be S total species in the ecological locale. 

# Generating Parameters
The general approach to simulation is to generate and report a base set of parameters and to then simulate the dynamics of such a process according to those parameters. There are three types of parameters to this model: (1) intrinsic birth rate, (2) intrinsic death rate, and (3) interactions with other species. 

The intrinsic birth and death rates are specific to each species present in the model. 

# Simulating Generalized Lotka-Volterra Model
How do we choose an interaction matrix (consider a Normal [2 params] or Uniform [2 params; -0.1 and 0.1])
How do we perturb the interaction row once the mutation has occurred.
